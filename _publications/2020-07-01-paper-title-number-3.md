title: "Both Vertebral Bone Mineral Density and Presence or Growth of Schmorl's Node Are Important Pedictors for Future Vertebral Fracture"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-10
excerpt: 'Investigated the relationship between thoracic vertebral bone mineral density (BMD), Schmorl's Node presence/growth and presence of vertebral fracture in 3409 consecutive patients (1730 F) who underwent non-contrast heart and chest CT scans. Schmorl's Node prevalence increased progressively with advanced age and was inversely related to BMD. Both Schmorl's Node presence and vertebral BMD were shown to be associated with VF.'
