title: "Both Vertebral Bone Mineral Density and Presence or Growth of Schmorls Node Are Important Pedictors for Future Vertebral Fracture"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-schmorls
excerpt: 'Investigated the relationship between thoracic vertebral bone mineral density (BMD), Schmorls Node presence/growth and presence of vertebral fracture in 3409 consecutive patients (1730 F) who underwent non-contrast heart and chest CT scans. Schmorls Node prevalence increased progressively with advanced age and was inversely related to BMD. Both Schmorls Node presence and vertebral BMD were shown to be associated with VF.'
