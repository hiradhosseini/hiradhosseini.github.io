excerpt: 'Compared thoracic Quantitative Computed Tomography (tQCT) and lumbar dual X-ray absorptiometry (IDXA) for predicting age-related osteoporosis and osteoporotic vertebral fracture in 360 patients (46 with VF). tQCT demonstrated superior sensitivity for predicting both osteoporosis and osteoporotic VF risk.'
