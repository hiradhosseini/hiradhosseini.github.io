title: "Predicting Atmospheric Air Pollution: A Convolutional-Transformer Approach for Spatial and Temporal Analysis of PM2.5"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-conv-transformer
excerpt: '6.7 million premature deaths occur annually due to household and ambient air pollution. Air pollution affects individuals globally and can be derived from a variety of factors including household cooking fuel, motor vehicles, industrial practices, and natural fires. To tackle this global crisis, our research focuses on understanding the spatial and temporal patterns between air pollutants to predict future levels of air pollutants. Our approach uses a novel deep learning methodology that involves a spatiotemporal Convolutional-Transformer architecture (ConvTransformer).'
