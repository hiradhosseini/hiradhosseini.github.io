title: "Thoracic QCT From Heart Scan Can Monitor Age-Related Bone Loss Sensitively: A Comparing with DXA and QCT Study"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-07-01
excerpt: 'Investigated the diagnostic value of BMD-aimed lumbnar CT scan, hip and lumbar DXA scan, and heart CT scan to measure coronary calcified plaque burden for 457 asymptomatic patients (197 F). Thoracic and lumbar QCT both demonstrated greater sensitivity to age-related bone loss than hip DXA. Therefore, thoracic QCT derived from existing lung or heart CT scans can provide a more sensitive assessment of bone loss than DXA, barring additional radiation or costs.'
