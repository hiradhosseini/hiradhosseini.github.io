excerpt: 'Air pollution is the fourth-largest threat to human health. The harmful effects of air pollutants have costed the global economy nearly $3 trillion. It is imperative that a solution for mitigating the harmful effects of the most pervasive ground-level air pollutants - Carbon Monoxide $(CO)$ , Nitric Oxide $(NO)$ , Nitrogen Dioxide $(NO_{2})$ , Ozone $(O_{3})$ , and particulate matter 2.5 $(PM2.5)$ - is implemented, especially in urban areas. Recent advances in deep learning such as the Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) architecture are capable of learning complex spatiotemporal patterns with multisource data. We propose a novel sequential encoder-decoder ConvLSTM architecture capable of predicting hourly $CO, NO, NO_{2}, O_{3}$ , and $PM2.5$ spatially continuously over Los Angeles. Our model utilizes multisource satellite imagery collected from the ESA Tropospheric Monitoring …'
