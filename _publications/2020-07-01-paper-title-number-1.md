excerpt: 'Observed a statistically significant decrease in Agatston score and plaque burden volume when comparing Iterative Reconstruction (IR) algorithm scans to Filter Back Projection (FBP) scans across all five groups with varying electric current products ranging from 17 to 75 mAs. This finding suggests the necessity of calibrating coronary calcium scores derived from IR scans based on exposure dosage.'
