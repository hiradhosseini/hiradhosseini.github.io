excerpt: 'Conducted multi-row detector CT heart scan for obtaining coronary plaque score for 2267 patients (age 65+-11, 1231 F) with hypertension and anti-hypertensive therapy and matching control group. A significant higher tBMD was found in patients using anti-hypertensive therapy as compared to the normotensive population. Therefore, anti-hypertensive drugs can reduce the rate of vertebral bone mineral loss, with specific medication class being investigated.'
