excerpt: 'Investigated the prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs) across nearly 3500 patients (1730 F) via observation of morphological deformities of spinal bodies in CT chest or heart scans. Patients were separated into five distinct age ranges: 20-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70 and >80 years. The prevalence of VF increased across all age ranges, with the most profound increase in VF frequency observed in the fifth age range (>80 years). This study also corroborated the diagnostic value of chest CT scan as a relatively cheap, low-radiation approach for estimating VFs.'
