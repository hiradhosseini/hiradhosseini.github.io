excerpt: 'Air pollution has become one of the most pressing challenges facing policy-makers and researchers worldwide. Governments are reckoning with the human, environmental, and economic impacts of air quality-related damages. In 2019, air quality-related issues caused over 7 million air-quality-related deaths, and nearly $8.1 trillion in health-related economic damages. Addressing these issues will require major infrastructural investment and new initiatives from policy-makers and legislators.'
