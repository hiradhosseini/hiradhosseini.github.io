title: "Global High-Resolution PM2. 5 Prediction Applying Multisource Big Data through Deep Convolutional LSTM"

excerpt: 'Ambient air pollution is a silent killer. It contributes to 7 million deaths annually and accounts for a 2.2 year reduction in the average global life expectancy. Moreover, more than one in four deaths of children under the age of 5 can be directly linked to the harmful effects of air pollution. Air pollution is most detrimental in highly urbanized metropolitan areas, and since it is projected that more than two thirds of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050, it is imperative we mitigate the severe effects of this harmful global threat.'

Ambient air pollution is a silent killer. It contributes to 7 million deaths annually and accounts for a 2.2 year reduction in the average global life expectancy. Moreover, more than one in four deaths of children under the age of 5 can be directly linked to the harmful effects of air pollution. Air pollution is most detrimental in highly urbanized metropolitan areas, and since it is projected that more than two thirds of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050, it is imperative we mitigate the severe effects of this harmful global threat.
