I'm currently a second-year undergraduate student in the [Quantitative and Computational Biology (QCB) Department](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu/) at the University of Southern California. As a Quantitative Biology student, I frequent the Viterbi School of Engineering for my computer science coursework in conjunction with upper-level bioinformatics and chemistry coursework at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. 

I am also a Data Science Researcher involved in the [Predicting What We Breathe](https://airquality.lacity.org/) project funded by a NASA grant for Advanced Information Systems and Technology. My work focuses on leveraging city-wide low-cost sensor data and state of the art machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to construct the first [Digital Twin City](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096232021000238) of Los Angeles. Building the first DTC of the city can glean valuable insights into the factors causing air pollution in the city, giving way for machine learning-modulated evidence-based policymaking and governance to ameliorate the iminent health, economic and environmental threats of deteriorating air quality. 

I have previously conducted multiple research projects on cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) at [The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation](https://lundquist.org/) affiliated with Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. I have also investigated the diagnostic value of core needle biopsies and rare cryptococcal infections at the UCI Department of Pathology and Microbiology.

I would love to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hirad-hosseini-1899231b0/) and potentially collaborate on AI/ML and bioinformatics projects. You can also reach out to me via email: [hosseini.hirad@gmail.com](mailto:hosseini.hirad@gmail.com).
