I'm currently a second-year undergraduate student in the [Quantitative and Computational Biology (QCB) Department](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu/) at the University of Southern California. As a Quantitative Biology student, I frequent the Viterbi School of Engineering for my computer science coursework in conjunction with upper-level bioinformatics and chemistry coursework at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
