Work experience
======
* Data Science Researcher (August 2021- Present)
  * NASA, City of Los Angeles
  * Funded internship in [Predicting What We Breathe (PWWB) Project](https://airquality.lacity.org/) conducted in collaboration with NASA, CSULA, OpenAQ, and the City of Los Angeles. PWWB has received several NASA grants for Advanced Information Systems and Technology (AIST). My work focuses on leveraging city-wide low-cost sensor data and state of the art machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to construct the first Digital Twin City of Los Angeles. Building the first DTC of the city can glean valuable insights into the factors causing air pollution in the city, giving way for machine learning-modulated evidence-based policymaking and governance to ameliorate the iminent health, economic and environmental threats of deteriorating air quality.
